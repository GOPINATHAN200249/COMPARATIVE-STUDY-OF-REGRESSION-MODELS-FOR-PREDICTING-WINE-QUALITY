1 Python-based machine learning techniques were used to predict wine quality with an emphasis on acidity and
 alcohol content.
2.XGBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees and Random Forest were among the regression models
 employed for analyzing wine related data as well as identifying most important features.
3 55.54 percentage accuracy with Extra Trees Regression algorithm was achieved. This was chosen for future
 wine quality forecasts. Model building was simplified and better decision making in wine industry was enhanced
 through interactive exploration and visualization done in Jupyter Notebook.
